This is a second version of the app. The first one is up and running http://geekscore.netlify.com/.
Source code of the first version could be found here: https://github.com/DavidGolodetsky/GeekScore-1
The main difference for now is that the first version is using Firebase as a backend, while the second version is written with Node.js and Mongo DB. The idea is that both version would exist in the future, but the second one would be continuously  improved, while the first one would be sealed.

## For contributors:

### To start Backend
run `npm run serve` in the **root**  folder

### To start Frontend
run `npm run serve` in the **client** folder
